Checkout Coding Test
====================

Candidate: Ruben Martin, alice@finitud.org

Further improvements:

* Proper tests for the pricers and Checkout classes.

* Support for other global pricers (i.e. tax) and item pricers for other types of offer.

* Better implementation for promotional rules and inventory.

* The promotional rules currently encode the whole inventory as well. A next step would be to separate these two.
